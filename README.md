# A simple music discovery project

Sometimes I get truly sick of my entire music library. I crave some playlist or radio service to take me to a musical landscape that I've never been before. Enter this web app.

It allows you to generate a playlist based off three or more artists, **not including those seed artists** or **any of the artists in your Spotify library.** The playlist attempts to choose music that sounds like those artists with a focus on high adventurous and variety in artist selection.

Currently all playlists can only be exported to Spotify. Playlist generation is powered by [echonest](http://developer.echonest.com/docs/v4).

Hosting it [here](http://fuckwhatyouheard.herokuapp.com) for now.
